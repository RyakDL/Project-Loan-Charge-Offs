Instructions for ETL and Data Analytics:

A) ETL Overview
1) There are several Excel files in the Resources folder that need to be transformed from Quarterly Data to Monthly Data.

2) In order to get these transformations done by this Saturday so we can so we can start Analytics and Visualizations this weekend,
we need to transform and form the Excel data this Wednsday and Thursday night. Then, I can create the DataFrame on Friday and label it,
"Combined_Data_Frame.csv" which we will use for data analysis.

3) There are 14 Quarterly Excel files that need to be transformed. I have already transformed the data in the "C&I_CO_QTR.xls" file to monthly.

4) In order to achieve 100% transformation by this Friday, we need to break up the workload. The following spreadsheets are assigned:
  a) Ryan Lund (3) - C&I_DELNG_QTR; CCARD_CO_QTR; CCARD_DELNG_QTR, 
  b) Hamid Nazari (3) - CORP_DEBT_NET_WORTH_QTR, CORP_SAVINGS_LEVEL_QTR; CRE_CO_QTR;  
  c) Joseph Gonzalez (3) - CRE_DELINQ_QTR; GDP_QTR; Homeowner_Vacancy_Rate_QTR;
  d) Lu Ye (2) -  Household_DBT_Inc_QTR; Mortgage_CO_QTR; 
  e) Cristian Guerrero (2) - Mortgage_DELNG_QTR; Rental_Vacancy_Rate_QTR.

B) ETL Instructions: 

1) The earliest common date is 1991. Any data earlier than that can be deleted. 
2) Delete the top ten lines so the heads are observation date and the Name of the data column.
3) Rename the data column to reflect the file name without the "QTR". 
4) transform the data by a) creating two rows after the row of data, b) clicking and dragging the date downward twice, c) then click the box and select "months"
so the date advances on months. Then click and drag the numberical data downward and just copy it. 

C) Leaders for the Analytics and Visualizations

1) FIRST: GOAL IS ETL TRANSFORMATION COMPLETE ON THURSDAY NIGHT (CREATE DATAFRAME AND PRODUCE ONE CSV FILE FOR ANALYTICS).

2) Three steps for visualizations and analysis:
  a) Seaborn correlations and scatterplots - leader: Ryan
  b) Supervised Machine Learning and Logistic or Polynomial Regressions - Leader: Joseph; secondary: Cristian
  c) Neural Network - Leader: Hamid; secondary: Lu

3) Presentation: Stephanie prepare the presentation. GOAL: Start Presentation on MONDAY NIGHT CLASS which is 11/13/23
